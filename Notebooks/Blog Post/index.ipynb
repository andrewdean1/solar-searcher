    "# Abstract\n",
    "As the severity of climate change continues to increase and the consumption of energy in the US remains massive, a critical focus of today’s power industry is establishing sources of renewable energy to replace less climate-friendly alternatives.  Three of the most common avenues for renewable energy solutions are in solar-, hydro-, and wind-powered generators.  Focusing on solar energy systems, we aim to address the problem of locating optimal regions throughout the US to build solar farms for cleaner energy production.  Our general approach to this problem is to determine the predicted energy output of installing a solar system at a given coordinate location in the continental US.  Leveraging several machine learning techniques to assist our success, we chose to frame this problem as a standard regression task performed by a predictive model.  For training and informing the design of our predictive models, we collected, cleaned, and combined location-specific data from several sources on weather, elevation, and solar statistics throughout the continental US.  Our modeling approach involves the use of a custom neural network and experimentation with different network layers and nonlinear activation functions.  In addition to constructing our custom models, we fit and evaluated a standard linear regression model from the `sklearn` library to compare predictive performance across several model architectures (performance assessed via Mean-Squared-Error loss minimization).  From our model tuning and comparison procedures, we found that a linear regression model using the ReLU activation function offers the most accurate solar energy predictions.  To visualize and interpret our findings, we developed an interactive map of the continental US, displaying predicted solar energy output (in kWh/kWp) at a resolution of approximately 4 km².  We intend for our potential solar energy map to stand as a practical tool for guiding future solar system development and planning.\n",

    "### Irradiance\n",
    "\n",
    "Solar irradiance (measured in W/m2) quantifies the instantaneous power of sunlight striking a surface. We used Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) – the sum of direct beam and diffuse sky radiation on a level plane – as the primary input for photovoltaic (PV) yield models, since PV output scales roughly linearly with incident irradiance (@nrel2025). Our GHI data from the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), published as the Physical Solar Model version 3 (PSM v3) from 1998-2016. This dataset contains monthly and annual GHI averages covering 0.038-degree latitude by 0.038-degree longitude (roughly 4 km by 4 km). This data was produced by merging satellite cloud-detection with radiative transfer clear-sky (REST2) and cloudy-sky (FARMS) models. Each row corresponds to one grid cell’s location, and reports its twelve monthly mean GHI values. There are some limitations to consider upon using this dataset. Firstly, values are monthly means, meaning they omit potential important peaks or lows. Next, panel tilt – finding the optimal angle to capture GHI – is not captured nor discussed by NREL. Lastly, recent climatic trends are not reflected as this data spans only up until 2016; overall weather patterns and irradiance values may have fluctuated since then.\n"
